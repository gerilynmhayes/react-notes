Refer to Kent's [Uses Page](https://kentcdodds.com/uses/) to set up your build environment like his; will make following along after watching the tutorial in its entirety.

### Create a User Interface with Vanilla JavaScript and DOM

In this video, Kent shows us the necessary code to create the user interface. He tells us that we're going to need to append our JavaScript DOM (Document Object Model) elements, which will be the `root` of our application.

Note: The *definition of an API*, according to Wikipedia:

> An application programming interface is a computing interface which defines interactions between multiple software intermediaries. It defines the kinds of calls or requests that can be made, how to make them, the data formats that should be used, the conventions to follow, etc. It can also provide extension mechanisms so that users can extend existing functionality in various ways and to varying degrees. An API can be entirely custom, specific to a component, or it can be designed based on an industry-standard to ensure interoperability. Through information hiding, APIs enable modular programming, which allows users to use the interface independently of the implementation. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API)
